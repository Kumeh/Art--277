    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    <strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
    1950s, when an unknown printer took a galary of type and scrambled it to make
    a type specimenbook. it has survived not obly centuries, but alsothe leap into
    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchangeg. It was was popularised
    in the 1960s with the release of the latest sheets containing lorem Ipsum passages,
    and more recently with the desktop publishing software like
    <em>
      <strong><u>Aidus PageMaker</u>
      </strong>
    </em> including versions of Lorem Islum.
    <font font-text="arial narrow" Color="black">1914 translation by H. Rackham</font>
    </div>
    <!--This is the translated version of the above text which is indented by blockquote-->
    <blockquote>Lorem Ipsum dolor sit amet, consecteuradipiscing alit, sed do eiusmod tempor
      incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis
      nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
      Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore

      <h1> Why do we use it?</h1>
      It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
      content of a page when lookong at its layout. the point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u>      is that it has a more-or-less normal distrubution of letters, as opposed
      to using "Content here, contemt there", making it look like readable English.
      Many desktop publishing packages and web pwge editors now use Lorem Ipsum
      as their default model text, and a search for "Lorem Ipsum" will uncover
      many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have envolved over
      the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and
      the like).


    </p>

    <h1> Where can I get some?</h1>
    <strong>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
      have suffered alteration in some forms, by injecting humour, or <u>randonrized words</u>      which don't look even slightly belivable.
    </strong> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
    sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
    <em> All the lorem Ipsum generators on the internet, tends to respeat predefined
      chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the internet.</em>
    It uses directory of over 200 Latinwords, conbined with a handful of model
    sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. the generated
    Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,injected homour, or non-characteristic
    words, etc.
